1)open the folder in Vs Code
2)open the terminals for server and clients
3)In the server terminal write:
     javac Server.java
4)press enter
5)then write the command:
    java Server

6)do the same for client:

    javac Client.java
    java Client

 as of now there is some synchronisation problem because of which the one prisoner's message is not broadcasted 
 but it works perfectly with one client at a time and no.of clients can join as many as you want .
 it does not close the server until we close the terminal.I have purposefully kept it this way but this can be modified.
